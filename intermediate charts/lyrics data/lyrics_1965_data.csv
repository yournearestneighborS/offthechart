I Got You Babe,Sonny & Cher,Pop,"Despite their pledges of love in this song, within 10 years, the couple was divorced.
They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you

Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring, I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe",despite their pledges of love in this song within 10 years the couple was divorced they say were young and we dont know we wont find out until we grow well i dont know if all thats true cause you got me and baby i got you babe i got you babe i got you babe they say our love wont pay the rent before its earned our moneys all been spent i guess thats so we dont have a pot but at least im sure of all the things we got babe i got you babe i got you babe i got flowers in the spring i got you to wear my ring and when im sad youre a clown and if i get scared youre always around so let them say your hairs too long cause i dont care with you i cant go wrong then put your little hand in mine there aint no hill or mountain we cant climb babe i got you babe i got you babe i got you to hold my hand i got you to understand i got you to walk with me i got you to talk with me i got you to kiss goodnight i got you to hold me tight i got you i wont let go i got you to love me so i got you babe i got you babe i got you babe i got you babe i got you babe

It's The Same Old Song,Four Tops,"motown, northern soul, soul","You're sweet (You're sweet) as a honeybee
But like a honeybee stings, you've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left (All you left) is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories (Sweet memories)
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Now it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you've been gone)
And it breaks me up to hear it
I, oh, I

A sentimental fool (Sweet, sweet memories) am I
To hear an old love song and wanna cry
But the melody (Sweet, sweet memories) keeps calling me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
I keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Saying, ""Together forever, (Darling) breaking up never""

(It's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it
(With a different meaning since you've been gone) Since you've been gone, oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

Precious memories (Sweet, sweet memories) keep lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone (Sweet, sweet memories), there's this emptiness
I only reminisce the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Now it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
I, oh, I can't bear to hear it
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

Like A Rolling Stone,Bob Dylan,"folk rock, folk, singer-songwriter, roots rock, country rock","Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags, and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home

Save Your Heart For Me,Gary Lewis And The Playboys,Rock,"*whistling*

Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you
And save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under starlit skies
Please don't let the stars get in your eyes
Just save your heart for me

When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know
So, save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me

Down In The Boondocks,Billy Joe Royal,northern soul,"Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her, she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks

Every night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill
I love a little girl that lives up there, and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door 'cause her daddy is my boss man
So I'll just have to be content to see her whenever I can

Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks

One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never, never will look back
Until that mornin' I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time

Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks

So I do my very best to please him

To him I'm loyal, to him I'm true
Why can't he be the same way too?
But the more my love has grown
The less love he had shown
He makes promises he doesn't keep

Give me just one little sign

Since I Lost My Baby,The Temptations,"motown, soul","The sun is shining (Oh yeah)

But fun is a bore
And with money I'm poor

Eve Of Destruction,Barry McGuire,folk rock,"The Eastern world, it is explodin'
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're totin'?
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say?
And can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy

And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'
I'm sittin' here just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation
Handful of senators don't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'

And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space
But when you return, it's the same old place
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

And tell me over and over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Looking Through The Eyes Of Love,Gene Pitney,Pop,"In the eyes of the world
I'm a loser just wastin' my time
I can't make a dime
In the eyes of the world
Being born was my first big mistake
I can't get a break

But in the eyes of my woman, I stand
Like a hero, a giant, a man who's as tall as can be
Any fool can see

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love (Lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (Lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me

In the eyes of the crowd
I'm a do-nothin' kind of a guy
Who'll just live and die
In the eyes of the crowd
I'm another poor Joe on the street
Can't get on my feet

But in the eyes of my woman, they're wrong
I'm a king and a lover as strong and as brave as can be
Any fool can see

That she's lookin' through the eyes of love (Lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love (Lookin' through the eyes of love)

You'd Better Come Home,Petula Clark,Pop,"1 ContributorYou’d Better Come Home LyricsYou'd better come home and stop your running around
You'd better come home and get your feet on the ground

You'd better be smart, you've gotta make up your mind
Stop breaking my heart and leave the others behind
Cause I won't share my love whatever I do
The love that I give for as long as I live will be yours
And nothing can change the way that I feel
So, baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)

Summer Nights,Marianne Faithfull,Pop,"Oh, how I've waited so long
For summer nights
When there's magic in the air
And I don't have a care
All that matters to me
Is that you are here
On summer nights
There's a little cafe
Where we can hear music play
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go
There you'll hold me tight and say
Our love will always be this way
On summer nights
At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand
On summer nights
In our little cafe
We'll dance the night away
And we know our love will be
Always true eternally
And when the moon begins to shine
I can see that you are mine
On summer nights

Do you believe in magic, in a young girl's heart?
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind


If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah, do you believe in magic? yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Oh, talkin' 'bout the magic

You don't need a telephone
Or need a postcard, Lord to reach me, dear
Open up the window to your heart
Lord, you'll find me there, standing near
With these hands, I am able
To make your wish, a dream come true
Oh Lord, tell me darling, let me know ya
Let me know, what you want me to do
With these hands, I can move mountains
And with these hands, oh Lord, I can work miracles
And with thеse hands, I know, I know I'm able
To make all of your wishеs
