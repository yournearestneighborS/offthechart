If this world were mine

Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply

Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure

Die With A Smile,Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars,"art pop, pop","(Ooh, ooh)

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

(Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending

Ordinary,Alex Warren,Pop,"They say, ""The holy water's watered down
And this town's lost its faith
Our colors will fade eventually""
So, if our time is runnin' out
Day after day
We'll make the mundane our masterpiece

Oh my, my
Oh my, my love
I take one look at you

You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out of the ordinary
You got me kissin' thе ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return mе to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

Hopeless hallelujah
On this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?
At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

Oh my, my

Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

Somethin' so out of the ordinary

Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?

I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""

'Cause I'll be out 'til the lights are on
And I'm a gambler
I'll take the over on the underdog, huh

Girl, half of this town has got a name for me
And I can't say I don't agree, huh

But the night I said, ""I'm leavin',"" I turned into Richard Petty
Broke my heart, so I got even in my '97 Chevy
Now I'm walkin' on this water mixed with Johnnie Walker Black
There's a lot of reasons I ain't Jesus, but the main one is that I ain't comin' back
Oh no, no, I ain't comin' back

You call me thе devil
Then you told me whеre to go
Go throw your pebbles
I'll be somewhere gettin' stoned
Girl, it ain't my fault
Ain't no need to wait three days
I might be a lot of things
But I ain't your savin' grace

Yeah, the night I said, ""I'm leavin',"" I turned into Richard Petty
Broke my heart, so I got even in my '97 Chevy
Now I'm walkin' on this water mixed with Johnnie Walker Black
There's a lot of reasons I ain't Jesus, but the main one is that I ain't comin' back

Beautiful Things,Benson Boone,Pop,"For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay

All The Way,BigXthaPlug Featuring Bailey Zimmerman,southern hip hop,"Don't let me down easy, if you're gonna leave me
Baby, go and leave me all the way
Don't ask for all your things back, cussin' out my name, yeah
Just to go and take back what you say
Burn all the bridges, don't ask forgiveness
Walk away like I'm someone you hate
Don't let me down easy, if you're gonna leave me
Baby, go and leave me all the way

Ayy, if it's over, it's over, so fuck it
Just don't act like my love wasn't nothin'
Like I wasn't the one you was holdin' at night
Tellin' all of your secrets and huggin'
Guess you right, it's too good to be true
What's the point? All I needed was you
But shit, time after time, all this fussin' and fighting
It's time that you do what you do
And it's cool
Mama said it was fish in the sea, I got lost in the pool
Knew it was comin', I watched how you move
How you turn your back on me and leave me to lose?
Remember the text, how you said that you'd do
Said that you'd never leave, we would fight 'til it's due
But as it went on, I was fightin' for you
Sent a text, it turned green, why the fuck it ain't blue?
Guess you done and I get it
Said you'd stay and you wanted my name and you left, so I'm guessin' that you never meant it
Said you'd try and hold on 'cause the love was so strong, now I'm standing alone this kitchen
Singin' sad songs, but I'm knowin' that this shit don't last long
If you leavin', then leave 'cause your bags gone
But just know, you can never come back home

Don't let me down easy, if you're gonna leave me

Walk away like I'm someone you hate
Don't let me down easy, if you're gonna leave me
Baby, go and leave me all the way

Ayy, if you say that you done, ain't no take backs
Said you fell out of love and I hate that
But see me, I was stuck like a drug, really fiendin' for love and somehow, I can't shake back
When you walked out that door, I was hurtin'
All the dreams in my head, you was perfect
You remember the very first time that we chilled and I reached for your hand, where them nerves at?
Time will pass and shit, that's what it do
It be times I be sick, sittin' thinkin' 'bout you
It was death do us part 'til you gave me the blues
Really played my heart, left me lost and confused
Thought this shit was fair game, but you made up the rules
On my heart, left a scar and a bruise
Hope that you can stand on all the shit that you did
'Cause I'm done, yeah, I'm finally through

Don't let me down easy, if you're gonna leave me
Baby, go and leave me all the way
Don't ask for all your things back, cussin' out my name, yeah

You're an idiot, now I'm sure

Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh

Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling

Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena

Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance

You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Messy,Lola Young,R&B/Soul,"You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waiting outside the station
When it was like minus four degrees?
And I, I get what you're sayin'
I just really don't wanna hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me
I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die lucky if I turned thirty-three
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
Every other week
But cut me some slack, who do you want me to be?

'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job"", then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect till I open my big mouth
I want to be me, is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect till I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate, you hate

It's taking you ages
You still don't get the hint, I'm not asking for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And, please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But, hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you out gettin' stoned at 4 o'clock?
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello
'Cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes

'Cause I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job"", then you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect till I open my big mouth
I want to be me, is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever, and then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect till I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot


Oh, and I'm too messy, and then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job"", then you ask where the hell I've been

Fuck being rational, give 'em what they ask for

It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

They like, ""What he on?""
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revеlation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and makе you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

Ain't with my type activities? Then don't you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send 'em all
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I'm trippin' for my dog
Who you with? Couple sergeants and lieutenants for the get back
This revolution been televised, I fell through with the knick-knacks
Hey, young nigga, get your chili up, yeah, I meant that
Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that
Hey, what's up, though?
I hate a bitch that's hatin' on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a nigga hatin' on them niggas and they both broke
If you ain't coming for no chili, what you come for?
Nigga feel like he entitled 'cause he knew me since a kid
Bitch, I cut my granny off if she don't see it how I see it, hm
Got a big mouth but he lack big ideas
Send him to the moon, that's just how I feel, yellin'

Ain't no other king in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'

Tryna feel good inside, he never wanna hold me
Pipe me up, you get me hype, you my favorite coach
Come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice

I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life

Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk like Kenny, like boss
Like Solána, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?

Tonight, I ain't bringin' no roses
Talkin' would take too much time
I think I just better show you
Just turn the lights down, let's get right down to it

I don't wanna be out of line
But, girl, I can't wait anymore

I want you in the worst way
My hands are needin' your hips
Want the first taste
Of whiskey to be off your lips
So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break
Baby, I need you tonight
Let's see how much love we can make
I want you in the worst way

Baby, that don't mean that I
Don't love to go wine and dine you
That ain't on the menu tonight
'Cause I think I need to remind you
That your skin on my skin
Feels just like heaven to me
You look like an angel tonight
But you might wanna slip off those wings

I want you in the worst way
My hands are needin' your hips
Want the first taste
Of whiskey right off of your lips
So close all the blinds, lock all the doors
Put away anything that'll break

Good News,Shaboozey,Country,"Man, what a hell of a year it's been
Keep on bluffin', but I just can't win
Drowned my sorrows, but they learned to swim
Man, what a hell of a year it's been
Head in a bottle, but my heart in a case
It's gettin' harder to act my age
Play a sad song on a tiny violin
For the man at the bar confessin' his sins

I need some good news
Sittin' here, sippin' on cold truth
Nobody knows what I'm goin' through
Bet the devil wouldn't walk in my shoes
Wish someone told me
Livin' this life would be lonely
Tryna get away from the old me
Still stuck singin' these blues
All I really need is a little good news

Love keeps knockin', but I just ain't home
Ain't pickin' no flowers from the seeds that I've sown
They say it gets darker when you're coverin' them doors
Still lookin' for the right at the end of my wrongs
At the end of my wrongs

I need some good news
Sittin' here, sippin' on cold truth
Nobody knows what I'm goin' through

Sailor Song,Gigi Perez,Alternative,"I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, ""Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?""

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever or until you wanna sit it out",i saw her in the rightest way looking like anne hathaway laughing while she hit her pen and coughed and coughed and then she came up to my knees begging baby would you please do the things you said youd do to me to me oh wont you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor and when you get a taste can you tell me whats my flavor i dont believe in god but i believe that youre my savior my mom says that shes worried but im covered in his favor and when were getting dirty i forget all that is wrong i sleep so i can see you cause i hate to wait so long i sleep so i can see you and i hate to wait so long she took my fingers to her mouth the kind of thing that makes you proud that nothing else had ever worked out worked out and maybe i tried other things but nothing can capture the sting of the venom shes gonna spit out right now oh wont you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor and when you get a taste can you tell me whats my flavor i dont believe in god but i believe that youre my savior i know that youve been worried but youre dripping in my favor and when were getting dirty i forget all that is wrong i sleep so i can see you cause i hate to wait so long i sleep so i can see you and i hate to wait so long and we can run away to the walls inside your house i can be the cat baby you can be the mouse and we can laugh off things that we know nothing about we can go forever or until you wanna sit it out
Weren't For The Wind,Ella Langley,country,"I wouldn't paint me as a heartbreaker
But I've said a few goodbyes
I'd make a promise but I know later
I'm bound to change my mind
Depending on the weather, I'm goin'
Hell, baby, nobody knows when
Yeah, if it was a different time
Might've been different in a different life

Maybe that plane wouldn't ever take off
Maybe that dust wouldn't fly off the drive
Maybe that tumbleweed and me
Wouldn't leave every other sunrise
Maybe I'd settle down, dig in some roots
Find me a farmhouse, find me you
Maybe I wouldn't be already gone again
If it weren't for the wind

I wouldn't stay wonderin' what's out there
I wouldn't saddle up on a breeze
I wouldn't disappear out of thin air
I could put down these wings

Maybe that plane wouldn't ever take off
Maybe that dust wouldn't fly off the drive
Maybe that tumbleweed and me
Wouldn't leave every other sunrise
Maybe I'd settle down, dig in some roots
Find me a farmhouse, find me you
Maybe I wouldn't be already gone again

Wildflower,Billie Eilish,Alternative,"Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time

Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)

Denial Is A River,Doechii,Hip-Hop/Rap,"Hey, I thought it was all over
What's up, Doechii?
Hey, girl
You know, it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
Has it really?
Probably since, like, your last EP, 'Oh the Places You'll Go'
Oh wow, it's been a minute, yeah (Yeah)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay

Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021

Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (Oh), fuck it

""Platinum record"" this, ""viral record"" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and—

Honestly, I can't even fucking cap no more, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By ""a lot,"" you mean drugs?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh

I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar ""oops"" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay? (Alright, word)

Indigo,Sam Barber Featuring Avery Anna,country,"I know you're worried at night, I won't find my way
And I'm tired of lyin' to myself just to get through each day
My head says, ""I shoulda never left""
And that my feet will soon lead to my death

I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
Well, I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo

I gave up a piece of my heart, then I turned to run
Oh, my head's in the clouds, but I don't feel close to the sun
And the light fades away from my face, and the tears fall like rain
So I turn my words all into faith, hope it's me that they save

Oh, I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson
Lord knows I'm startin' to wonder
If my true colors changed since I left ya

I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo
My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home
And I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone
Well, I used to shine bright like gold, now I'm all indigo

I'm startin' to question
If God's tryna teach me a lesson

If my true colors changed since I left ya

My colors are darker and cold, I think it's time that I went home

Who knew guys still brought flowers
Or picked up the phonе before a last call hour?
And not 'cause thеy cheated, and not 'cause they lied
And not 'cause they're sorta sorry after a fight
And wait, there's guys that can communicate
That aren't lookin' for a heart to break
Always thought hell no, no way

He holds me tight, then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go

Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection
It's gettin' messy, I fiend for your affection
Don't loosen your grip got a hold on me
Now, forever, let's get back together

Smile,Morgan Wallen,country,"I can't remember the last time
You looked as happy as you did tonight
Your tipsy friend grabbed that bartender
Gave him her phone and pulled us over there with her
He counted to three
And, baby, I haven't seen that side of you in forever
And I hate it's the truth but, baby, you never do when we're alone together

It was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while
It was good to see you smile
Even if it was just for the picture

They say a picture's worth a thousand words
But you ain't said onе since you woke up
Silly me, thinkin' wе could make it work
Can you blame me for getting my hopes up?
You know it took me right back to how it used to be
Baby, seeing us like that is still a little bittersweet

But it was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while
It was good to see you smile
Even if it was just for the picture

If someone were to see this, they'd think everything's alright
At least we got a pretty little moment frozen in time

Twilight Zone,Ariana Grande,pop,"Did I dream the whole thing?
Was I just a nightmare?
Different dimensions
Stuck in the twilight zone
Is this a black-and-white scene?
If so, then I'm in the gray one
Hope you win for best actor
'Cause I had you completely wrong

Does she know you're not who you say you are?
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all?

And it's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange, this I never do
Not that I miss you, I don't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened
It's not like I'd ever change a thing
'Cause I'm right here where I'm meant to be
Not that I'd call you, I won't
Sometimes, I just can't believe
You happened

Were we just mistaken?
Disguised our intentions?
Our nest was a masquerade (Masquerade)
Why do I still protect you?
Pretend these songs aren't about you (Songs aren't about you)
Hope this might be the last one
'Cause I'm not fooling anyone

Does she know you're not who you say you are?
'Cause I might give her a call
Or was I just not me at all?

And it's not like I'm still not over you
It's so strange, this I never do

Undressed,sombr,Indie Rock,"You had a dream, you wanted better
You were sick of all the holes in your sweater
You looked to me and wondered whether
I was the lamppost to which you were tethered

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me

You're sayin' to me what you're sayin' to me
But the glimmer in your eyes is telling me other things

I don't wanna get undrеssed
For a new person all ovеr again
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck
And have to pretend it's yours instead


I took the train to see my mother
I look across the tracks to see you with another
There's nothin' worse than seein' your lover
Moving on while you still suffer

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me

And other boys may need a map
But I can close my eyes

Could've left me just the way you found me
But you came and put your wings around me
Girl, you went out of your way
To fix what you didn't break

You were the star in the pitch black
Shine the way on the way back
Out of nowhere, answered all my prayers
Picked up the towel that I threw in
Took in a heart that was ruined
Showed me the past ain't a tattoo
Loved me, even when you didn't have to

Holy Smokes,Bailey Zimmerman,country,"Well, I was only scared of the devil and her dad
So we'd park somewhere we knew they'd never look
No, I never seen nothin' like her
Playing with the flame on her momma's lighter
No, it wasn't very long 'fore I was hooked

Heaven was a preacher's spot in that first church parking lot
Her hangin' onto me like the cross on a rearview does
Her eyes were blue, thе words were red, on that half pack of cigarеttes
At seventeen that's what hallelujah was
Life wasn't heavy in the back of that Chevy
Me, her, and the Holy Ghost
Somethin' 'bout us, hell of a rush
Fallin' in love, lightin' up them holy smokes  (Oh, oh)

They'd run us off but we'd come runnin' back
And we'd pick up where we left off the night before
She said ""How pissed off would your mama be
If we walked in there and you married me?""
Even if we never made it through them old wood doors

Heaven was a preacher's spot in that first church parkin' lot
Her hangin' onto me like the cross on the rearview does
Her eyes were blue, the words were red, on that half pack of cigarettes
At seventeen that's what hallelujah was
Life wasn't heavy in the back of that Chevy
Me, her, and the Holy Ghost
Somethin' 'bout us, hell of a rush
Fallin' in love, lightin' up them holy smokes (Oh, oh)

Backseat Driver,Kane Brown,"country, pop country","7:30 in the morning in a Mickey D's drive-thru
Two muffins, one coffee, and a little bitty orange juice
I saw a man with a sign on the corner
I rolled my window down, handed him a dollar
That's when I heard her ask
""Hey, daddy, who was that?""
And before I could answer back
She said

""Daddy, look, there's a plane in the sky
Are we there yet?
Did you just see that dog run by?
Do squirrels have houses in the trees?
Why'd God put stingers on honeybees?""
It's crazy all the things she sees on the side of the road
Out of that window beside her
I wish I could be more like her
My little dangling feet, pretty in pink, backseat driver

Later on that day, on the highway back home
I saw a lady in a black Mercedes yelling at her phone
She flew by me with her finger in the air
And I had to act like I didn't care
And that's when I heard her ask
""Daddy, why was she so mad?""
Before I could answer back
She said

""Daddy, can you please turn up the radio?
Hey, what are you pushing with your feet that makes us go?
Do squirrels have houses in the trees?
Why'd God put stingers on honeybees?""
It's crazy all the things she sees on the side of the road
Out of that window beside her
I wish I could be more like her
My little dangling feet, pretty in pink, backseat driver

One day, I'll look back and I'll miss when
My whole world wasn't over that dash
It was back there buckled in

Saying, ""Daddy, look, there's a plane in the sky""
Are we there yet?

Safe to say I'm the biggest, the largest
Been steppin' on shit since my mama stayed in them apartments, regardless
My daddy told me keep the heat even when I'm in foreigns, I'm heartless
'Cause these niggas is hatin' on me just because I'm the biggest, the largest
The biggest, the largest

30K on my wrist just for hard times
These niggas just mad 'cause thеy bitch in my archives
Jordan came back, throw the 45
If you play, thеn you lay right there by yo' own kind
Pour up a four in a Loko
Tell 'em run this bitch back like Soso
Got rap shit here in a chokehold
Did a show out in Austin, shoutout to Bobo
Moved out the trenches, now look how we live
Told my BM to furnish the crib
Walk out the mall with some shoes for the kids
Deposit a check, shit, my bank full of M's
Paid up my rent, now I'm up for the year
The view look crazy from here
What I paid for some dogs, could've bought me veneers
Texas piece on my neck, could've bought your career

Safe to say I'm the biggest, the largest

My daddy told me keep the heat even when I'm in foreigns, I'm heartless
'Cause these niggas is hatin' on me just because I'm the biggest, the largest

Ayy, stuffin' Cali' plug weed in the blunt
Let my lil' brother roll him a Dutch
My lil' boy get whatever he want
Madam T don't be askin' for much
Pourin' lean on the nuggets of runtz
Spill the rest of that drank in a punch
Left wrist on some ""I had to stunt""
Right wrist, I just did it because
600 the label, you know we comin'
Tell them niggas they ain't takin' nothin'
Standin' on business, we shootin' or punchin'
Hatin'-ass nigga, go get you some money
I just got off a tour, finna go on another one
Album done, finna drop me another one
Couple of M's, finna run up another one
Super Bowl rings, shit, I had to go double 'em

Safe to say I'm the biggest, the largest

Die Trying,"PARTYNEXTDOOR, Drake & Yebba",r&b,"Yeah

Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried
Or I should leave and say goodbye
It's killin' me inside

If I could just get next to you, I'd probably be alright
But we're so busy in this life
We always say, ""Some other time""
Why won't my tears work? It's been a decade since I've cried
I got no dog left in the fight
The bark don't match the bite
Me and my old man, we just get fucked up every night
He said, ""Son, these hoes just don't love you""
I said, ""I'll keep that in mind""
Those ain't words to live by, wouldn't call that sound advice
Our future doesn't sound too bright
But I just nod and say, ""You're right,"" I do

Or I should leave and say goodbye

I wish that they were still alive
Just to see the silver lines
This year, me and God, we wasn't seein' eye to eye
I prayed to her from time to time
She was busy on another vibe
I can't vent to you through no text message and reply
I need to see you face to face
Gotta look you in the eye, I do

Bulletproof doors so heavy, got me rollin' 'round like a dignitary
Funny how it's only bitch niggas that are waiting on the boy's obituary
'Cause if I die, it's these niggas that become the sole beneficiary
And what the fuck are they gon' do with it?
Have the girls up at 29 on stage twerkin' with a dictionary?
Guilt trips, not Turks trips when it's cold out here in February
'Cause right now, shorty parachuting molly like she flying for the military
This girl face so pretty, I can only think of fuckin' missionary

Fuck that, make the beat switch, turn the hoes up, give a million to 'em
Right now, I got so many villas booked, I'm like a villain to 'em
Durk's boy told me ""Marvin's Room"" was his favorite song, he was drilling to it
Thousand niggas rappin' murder shit and like ten niggas that'll really do it
Savage, you the only nigga checkin' on me when we really in some shit, brother
Melyssa Ford, you a legend from the 6ix, hate to see you with a dick-sucker
Shit about to be a lit summer, tell Tony leave the motor runnin'
Tell Mike that the ceiling's too low in Booby, how we supposed to throw a hundred?
Damn
They be droppin' shit, but we be droppin' harder shit (Droppin' harder shit)
Fuck a rap beef, I'm tryna get the party lit
Tryna get the party lit for the bitches
Them Nike tights is huggin' on that ass like they missed it
What's up?
Niggas is hating the boy for sure, the women in love
Walk in the strip club, damn, I missed you hoes, give me a hug
Give me a hug, give me a hug, give me a hug, give me a hug

Yeah, I know that you work in the club
Know that these people might judge
But fuck it, you family to us
So come over here and give me some love
Yeah, give me a hug
I miss you hoes, give me a hug
Give me a hug, give me a hug
What can I say? I miss you girls, I'm stuck in my ways
Princess, Gigi, Pooh, Pink, Luxury, y'all gotta come to the stage
Yeah, come to the stage and show me some love

Tattoo,Tito Double P,"corrido, corridos tumbados, corridos bélicos, electro corridos, música mexicana","Ay, mamá

Quiero olvidarte y, la neta, no puedo
Estoy cansado, ya tiré la toalla
No quiero dormirme porque te sueño
Y andando bien pedo, me metí otra raya
Viendo las fotos que nos tomamos
Y el videíto aquel en tu cama
Mientras una puta me está bailando
Tiro las pacas, ellas no fallan

¿Y dónde estás tú? Aún tengo el tattoo
Mientras tú tapaste con un ""fuck you"" el mío
No dejo dormir a los pinches vecinos
Con los tragos lloro, con un polvo me río
Y yo seguiré siendo un desmadre
Tú tendrás tu familia, pa' mí será tarde
Pidiendo otra onza, pidiеndo más vino
Tú querías tus hijos, pero no conmigo

House Again,Hudson Westbrook,country,"Well this kitchen used to be a dance hall
Music on and the lights off
Just you and I used to be
Perfume on your pillow
New day through the window
Bringing out the blue in your eyes
Used to be four boots by the front door
But two ain't there anymore

Now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete
And numbers on a mailbox on used to be street
I guess you or I should have left when you did
The house you made a home is
Now just a house again

These days all I hear is an echo
Of you saying baby don't go
And your goodbye
If you came back you'd be surprised
You wouldn't even recognize this place without you
What the hell did you do

Cuz now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete
And numbers on a mailbox on a used to be street
I guess you or I should have left when you did
The house you made a home is
Now just a house again

A kitchen that used to be a dance hall
With music on and the lights off

But now it's just 4 empty walls
Where I lay my head and get no rest at all
The porch swing don't swing
The doorbell don't ring
And now it's just wood on concrete

Ha, c'mon, it's gon' be fucking hard

Special edition and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues in the fittin' room and it's hot tea
No, I'm not thinking about no exes, know they miss me
I got the whole room spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us, take you to the chorus

Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?

얼말 줘도 못해 서커스짓
포징한번에 만들어 mosh pit
They can't deal with me 'cause I'm priceless
여러 셀럽들 속에 내 DNA
Get, get outta my way
바비가 처키가 되기 전에
Name, shame, blame tryna burst my bubble
터트려봐 그럼 더 큰 홀에서
만나는 거야 제니를 keep shading
예술작품엔 필요해 frame이
I've slayed it, and I graved it
Yes, I'm guilty 잘난 게 죄니 (Mmh)

Count me out like sovereigns, payback for the good times
Right foot in the roses, left foot on a landmine
I'm not gonna be there tripping on the grapevine
They can sing the words while I cry into the bassline
Wear me out like Prada, devil in my detail
I swear it's getting harder even just to exhale
Backed up into corners, bitter in the lens
I'm sick of tryna hide it every time thеy take mine

So stick to me
Stick to mе like caramel
Walk beside me till you feel nothin' as well

They ask me, ""Is it goin' good in the garden?""
Say, ""I'm lost, but I beg no pardon""
Up on the dice, but low on the cards
I try not to talk about how it's harder now
Can I get a mirror side-stage?
Looking sideways at my own visage, gettin' worse
Every time they try to shout my real name just to get a rise from me
Acting like I'm never stressed out by the hearsay
I guess that's what I get for tryna hide in the limelight
Guess that's what I get for having 20/20 hindsight
Everybody wants eyes on 'em, I just wanna hear you sing that top line

And if you don't think I mean it, then I understand
But I'm still glad you came, so let me see those hands

So stick to me
Stick to me like caramel
Walk beside me till you feel nothin' as well
I'm fallin' free of the final parallel
The sweetest dreams are bitter
But there's no one left to tell

Too young to get bitter over it all
Too old to retaliate like before
Too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know
So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm
This stage is a prison (Too young to get bitter over it all), a beautiful nightmare
A war of attrition (Too old to retaliate like before), I'll take what I'm given
The deepest incisions (Too blessed to be caught ungrateful, I know), I thought I got better
But maybe I didn't

(In these days of days) Tell me, did I give you what you came for?
(I wish it all away) Terrified to answer my own front door
(I thought things had changed) Missin' my wings in a realm of angels
(But everything's the same)

So I'll keep dancin' along to the rhythm

A war of attrition, I'll take what I'm given
