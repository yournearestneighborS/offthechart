The Power Of Love,Huey Lewis & The News,Rock,"The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmm-mm, hmm


It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' 'til you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love

You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love",the power of love is a curious thing make a one man weep make another man sing change a hawk to a little white dove more than a feeling thats the power of love tougher than diamonds rich like cream stronger and harder than a bad girls dream make a bad one good make a wrong one right power of love that keeps you home at night it dont need money dont take fame dont need no credit card to ride this train its strong and its sudden and its cruel sometimes but it might just save your life thats the power of love thats the power of love first time you feel it it might make you sad next time you feel it it might make you mad but youll be glad baby when youve found thats the power makes the world go round and it dont take money dont take fame dont need no credit card to ride this train its strong and its sudden and it can be cruel sometimes but it might just save your life they say that all in love is fair yeah but you dont care but you know what to do when it gets hold of you and with a little help from above you feel the power of love you feel the power of love can you feel it hmmmm hmm it dont take money and it dont take fame dont need no credit card to ride this train tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel you wont feel nothin til you feel you feel the power just feel the power of love thats the power thats the power of love you feel the power of love you feel the power of love feel the power of love

Growin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're trying to break free

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me

Just once in his life, a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like a man again, I'll hold my head high
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire
I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),Tina Turner,R&B/Soul,"Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children, the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives?
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome",out of the ruins out from the wreckage cant make the same mistake this time we are the children the last generation we are the ones they left behind and i wonder when we are ever gonna change living under the fear til nothing else remains we dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdome looking for something we can rely on theres got to be something better out there love and compassion their day is coming all else are castles built in the air and i wonder when we are ever gonna change living under the fear til nothing else remains all the children say we dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdome so what do we do with our lives we leave only a mark will our story shine like a light or end in the dark give it all or nothing we dont need another hero we dont need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the thunderdome
Summer Of '69,Bryan Adams,Rock,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no!
Yeah!

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah

Never Surrender,Corey Hart,synthpop,"Just a little more time is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty can bring you down

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender
And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
No one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

Oh, time is all we're asking for
To never surrender
Oh, you can never surrender

Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

You're Only Human (Second Wind),Billy Joel,soft rock,"Ooh-ooh yeah ooh
You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood

(It's alright) It's alright, sometimes that's what it takes
(You're only human) You're allowed to make your share of mistakes (Only human ooh-ooh)

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind

Ooh-ooh yeah
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again

(It's alright) It's alright though you feel your heart break
(You're only human) You're gonna have to deal with heartache
(You're only human)

Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone (Oh oh oh oh)
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
'Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
'Til that old second wind comes along
(Only human ooh-ooh)
(Only human)

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
(It's alright) It's alright, s-sometimes that's what it takes hahaha
We're only human, We're supposed to make mistakes (Only human ooh-ooh)

But I survived all those long lonely days (Oh oh oh oh)
When it seemed I did not have a friend
'Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again

Don’t forget your second wind
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in
One more time
Don’t forget your second wind
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in

Don’t forget your second wind (Only human ooh-ooh)

Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothing, get your chicks for free

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

Listen here, now, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothing, and your chicks for free

They came at night, leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Oh, nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
""I'm never coming back,"" they heard him cry
And I believe him
Well, he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Billy, Billy, don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no

Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop till they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand
They never asked him why
""Get out of my way,"" they heard him shout
Then a blinding light
Oh, all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

Now Billy, Billy, don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh, now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Don't give up, Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy, you better, you better
You better run for your life

Stand up and face the enemy

We will be invincible
And with the power of conviction
There is no sacrifice

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well on your way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only wanna share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing, you gotta look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

Life In One Day,Howard Jones,"new wave, synthpop","Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song
Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone
Chorus
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
The old man said to me
Said you can't change the world single-handedly
Raise a glass enjoy the scenery
Pretend the water is champagne
And fill my glass again and again
While the wolves are gathering round your door
Time will wear away the stone

Lonely Ol' Night,John Mellencamp,classic rock,"She calls me up and says, Baby, it's a lonely ol' night
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way
No, no, no, no, no

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone

Saving All My Love For You,Whitney Houston,Pop,"A few stolen moments is all that we shared
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through

Oh yeah
C'mon
Wooh
Huh

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool, boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days
Well, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days (Alright)

Well, there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school, she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday, I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband, Bobby, well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying, she starts laughing, thinking 'bout

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days (Rock it now)

My old man worked twenty years on the line
And they let him go
Now, everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old
I was nine-years old and he was working
At the Metuchen Ford plant assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion Hall
But I can tell what's on his mind

Glory days
Yeah, goin' back, glory days
Aw, he ain't never had glory days
Glory days

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back, trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days

Well, alright, ooh yeah

State Of the Heart,Rick Springfield,Rock,"I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in
I know your name, I told you mine
We've stopped and passed the time of day
You work in town, I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out
If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in
You are the moon, I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me
I was alone, I thought I was immune
It's good to know
The door can still be open wide
If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in
It's just the state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

We get closer and closer
To falling out or falling in
I go over and over
But I can't change the state
This heart is in
If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you

When Your Heart Is Weak,Cock Robin,Pop,"What's the matter with the way we look?
Surely it's not the end
I only meant to make my motions clear
You worry too much if it's understood
Should we be seen as friends?
Seems like a real good beginning right here

'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose

Better forget getting rid of me
I don't see how you can
You put me off and I will hunt you
Down...again
I'm mighty patient when I have to be
You have given me that
Still I look forward to the day you let me in

'Cause when your heart is weak
I'm gonna pick the lock on it
My fingertips won't fail me
No matter what you do
The love you cannot see yet
Is about to witness a dawning
And you can twist and turn
But you won't get loose

I'm gonna prove myself worthy
No more just hanging on
Without a prayer of a chance
I'm gonna come without warning
When your defenses are down and you're in
A desperate need
Oh, I bet you then, you'll welcome me...
Your ol' companion
Your ol' companion

I Wonder If I Take You Home,Lisa Lisa And Cult Jam With Full Force,"freestyle, funk melody","(Take me home)
(Take me home)

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
'Cause I'm not too sure 'bout how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt

Oh, I don't know
That's the way that I feel (The way that I feel)
I'm so afraid of a one night deal (I need you so)

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight, huh-ho

Your love is...
(Take me home)
(Huh-huh-huh-ho)

Lately, you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch?
You say I'm teasing, but I do have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me, and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait

Oh, I don't know
That's the way that I feel (The way that I feel)
I'm so afraid of a one night deal (I'm so afraid)
And sometimes

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Home, home)
Because I need you tonight (Home, home)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Home, home)
Because I need you tonight, huh-ho (Home, home)

And on the real side, if you love me
Huh, you would wait

Ooh, na-na-na-no, no
I wonder if I take you home
(Home, home, home, home)
I wonder if I take you home
Your love is...

(H-h-home) I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby?
Because I need you tonight, huh-ho

I wonder, I wonder, I really, really wonder (Home, home)
Take me home (Home, home)
I wonder, I wonder, I really, really wonder
Take me home
Your love is...
No good

They say beauty lies in the eye of the beholder (Huh-ho)
You're not sure you're the beholder of my eyes?
I gave our relationship more credit than it deserves
No, it's just that I feel you're rushing me
Okay, okay, since you don't love me
You don't wanna be with me
No, it's not that
It's just that I'm afraid of getting hurt
I don't know, I just keep asking myself
""Should I really take you home?""
What do you think?

Take me, take me, take me home

C-I-T-Y,John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band,Rock,"1 ContributorC-I-T-Y Lyrics
On the South side of Detroit city
I'm working all night on the line
Under black smoke stacks
Building Cadillacs, Jack
Not one of them will ever be mine
I'm gonna make it out of the city
Got an American dream that's true
Want a big red car and
A big white house and
A blue-eyed girl like you

You can spend all my money, honey
Na na na na, your man has come
It's alright

I'm living in the C-I-T-Y
Talking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Life here ain't no dream
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Walking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
You know what I mean

Times are tough in the Motor City
Where the bright lights used to shine
Got two rooms looking
Down a one-way street
Staring out at a dead-end sign
Little girl, I'm gonna be somebody
If it's the last thing I ever do
Buy the prettiest things
Good money can bring
There ain't nothing I won't do for you

And you can spend
All my money, honey
Na na na na, your man has come
It's alright

I'm living in the C-I-T-Y
Talking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Life here ain't no dream
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Walking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
You know what I mean

I'm living in the C-I-T-Y
Talking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Life here ain't no dream
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Walking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
You know what I mean
I'm living in the C-I-T-Y
Talking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Life here ain't no dream
Living in the C-I-T-Y
Walking hard times in the city
Living in the C-I-T-Y
You know what I mean
I'm living in the C-I-T-Y

I'm fading out of sight
My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of light
I can't slow down
Out on the open road
Racing to beat the night
No matter where I go
Guess I'll get there all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It used to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, and I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I took the one way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

So why don't I understand what's trippin' me up
I know it oughta be a simple thing

I can't hold on, and I can't return
Rivers will run, and bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)
But there's no lookin' back now


I can't hold on, I can't return
Rivers will run, bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)

Fortress Around Your Heart,Sting,"hindi hip hop, desi hip hop, punjabi hip hop","Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire

There was heat in the air
And cops everywhere you looked
There wasn't a lot
So the breaks that you've got, you know you took

And I remember wonderin' where you've been
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' ""Desolation Row"" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed, sanity prevailed

It was June or July
When the heat from above beat down
It was famine or drought
When the brothers went out of style uptown

And we was mixin' Vicks with lemon gin
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' ""Desolation Row"" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie made front page
His revolution came of age
He wrote ""Surrender"" on the wall
The night he took the fall

I heard someone say, ""He's trying to fly""
Like Eddie used to say, ""We'll do when we die""

I know someone turned you for a spin
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' ""Desolation Row"" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed, sanity prevailed

The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' ""Desolation Row"" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' ""Desolation Row"" on that radio

And when I get scared you're always around

Hey, hey!

She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's night
She was hangin' on Johnny, he was holdin' on tight
Oh, I could feel her coming from a mile away
There was no use talking, there was nothing to say
When the band began to play and play

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love, and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced, skah!

I met my be-bop baby at the Union Hall
She could dance all night and shake the paint off the wall
But when I saw her smile across a crowded room, yeah
Well, I knew we'd have to leave the party soon
As the band began to play out of tune

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love, and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced, yeah

The endless beat, she's walkin' my way
Hear the music fade when she says
Are we getting too close, do we dare to get closer
The room is spinning, she whispers my name

First Night,Survivor,Rock,"We will remember this first night forever
After all the songs fade away
And the stage fades to gray
And we will remember this first night together
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head
On the night we met

I'm searching your eyes, have I seen you somewhere?
You're filling my thoughts with a strange intrigue
I rivet my glance to your every movement
I got a notion your love's in a whole different league

Tell me your name, what's your persuasion?
Your first impression of this whole occasion

And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite
And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
And we'll fall in love again

In the air I can sense a strong attraction
Emotions run wild, are we on the verge?
We got a hotline to satisfaction
I got the answer if you got the urge

My motor is hot, I'm feeling elation
You came in the night with the right temptation

And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite
And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
And we'll fall in love again

Down On Love,Foreigner,"album rock, classic rock","Some people stay all alone and hide

Dry your eyes because your heart's gonna mend

But I know, I know that you're down on love

Your skies are so cloudy
And the tears come like falling rain
Face up to it and don't pretend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Just once in a life you'll realize
When love takes two, only one heart cries


In matters of the heart
You better know before you start
You can't get down on love
So always be prepared
To be alone and a little scared
But never down on love

Calls all his customers by name

You see a lot more meanness in the city
It's the kind that eats you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna stick by you
And someday soon
We're gonna get in that car
And get outta here


Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe we'll leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here

You Look Marvelous,Billy Crystal,Comedy,"And you know who you are
Come on, let's mingle
So nice to see you
Throw your hips into the air
Like Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire
Let's crazy go nuts
Just looking into your eyes, darling
I can tell that you have
The legs of a dancer
So bring those legs and the
Rest of your body over here
And be 'Nando's private prancer
Darling, I got to tell you something
And I don't say this to everybody
You look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous
You know, my dear
My father used to say to me
'Nando, don't be a schnook
It's not how you feel
It's how you look

He was marvelous but you, darling
You look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous
And this is from my heart
Which is deep inside my body
It's better to look good
Than to feel good
Get down (Let's rap!)
(Fernando?) darlings?
(Who's marvelous?) try me
(Cyndi Lauper?) marvelous
(Tina Turner?) still marvelous
(Jayne Meadows?) she's marvelous
(Grace Jones?) humongous
(Cher?) marvelous
(Chaka Khan?) marvelous
(Vanity?) marvelous
(Apollonia?) ditto
(Madonna?) her belly button is absolutely marvelous
I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it

Oh, look, there's Sting
Looking for his last name in the dip
I am what love is all about
I've got American teeth and a Spanish mouth
Please, hold me while I tango
So, my dear, it's been a blast
You were not my first, you won't be my last
Ciao, I've got to mambo
Nothing lasts forever, darling
But it's not the end of the world
When I was fired by Paramount
They were still MGM
I love you young people today
With your rock and roll
Like that Eddie Van Heflin
(Van Halen) whatever
When I look into your eyes, darling
I see the reflection of me
Look at me dancing around in there
I look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous

You know, darling, I love dancing
Dancing to me is like standing still, only faster
Do you know what I'm saying to you
My dear, do you understand the term full grown midget?
Must be me
There are eight million stories in the naked city, darling
Let's be two of them
I'm kidding you, I'm a kidder
Let's you and I go back
To my private hideaway
You put on some soft music
I'll put on my Spiderman pajamas
And we'll do things I'm going to
Tell my friends we did anyway
Darling, I'm worried about
The Cabbage Patch Kids
I mean, when they grow up
Will they be confused that these
People are not their real parents?
You know, I went to a Madonna concert
And the people come dressed like her
With the navel showing and the brassiere
And the ties with the pantyhose, and the beauty mark
And these were some of the guys
I tell you, this rock and roll is really nuts
If a train is leaving Chicago
At eleven A.M. in the morning
With five thousand pounds of bluefish
And another train is leaving Phoenix
At exactly the same time

Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said, now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Wise Up,Amy Grant,"christmas, ccm, christian","I'm not sure about
Climbing in where there's temptation
Can I get back out?
I never can quite find the answer
The one I want to hear
The one that justifies my action
Says the coast is clear
Something on the outside
Says to jump on in
But something on the inside
Is telling me again

Better wise up
Better think twice
Never leave room for compromise
You better wise up
Better get smart
And use your head to guard your heart
It's gonna get rough
So you better wise up
Take a look at your intentions
When you have to choose
Could it be that apprehension
Might be telling you
To back off now is better
So take your heart and run
But get your thoughts together
Before they come undone

I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire
Running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream
And crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement
Passion hits the street
Anger's cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy
I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door

Baby, stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it anymore

Hungry minds do stare you in the eye
Spread it thick
And lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel
Must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up
Baby, I'll be gone

Baby, stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow

Can't find love
Because it's trapped inside
Can't find freedom
Flirting with the line

Forever,Kenny Loggins,Rock,"Now, while we're here alone
And all is said and done
Now I can let you know
Because of all you've shown
I've grown enough to tell you
You'll always be inside of me

How many roads have gone by?
So many words left unspoken
I needed to be by your side
If only to hold you

Forever in my heart
Forever, we will be
And even when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever

Once, I dreamed that you were gone
I cried out trying to find you
I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me

But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
The love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember

Forever in my heart
Forever here, you'll be
Know that when I'm gone
You'll be near to me
Forever in my life
Always thought I'd be
I'd be yours

Forever",now while were here alone and all is said and done now i can let you know because of all youve shown ive grown enough to tell you youll always be inside of me how many roads have gone by so many words left unspoken i needed to be by your side if only to hold you forever in my heart forever we will be and even when im gone youll be here in me forever once i dreamed that you were gone i cried out trying to find you i begged the dream to fade away and please awaken me but night took a hold of my heart and left me with no one to follow the love that i lost to the dark ill always remember forever in my heart forever here youll be know that when im gone youll be near to me forever in my life always thought id be id be yours forever
Not Enough Love In The World,Don Henley,Rock,"Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do, and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like children on a playground
Even after that old sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darlin', this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera, and still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody, just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with, I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe, that's one of the things I loved about you
But the time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get off this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

For you, girl, oh girl
There's just not enough love in the world
Not enough love in the world
In the world
In the world

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am

The Search Is Over,Survivor,Rock,"According to former Survivor guitartist\keyboardist Jim Peterik about the song’s meaning:
It wasn’t about my life as much… Read More 
How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
The times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
'Til I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper

2,689 soldiers

All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average age was nineteen

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post-traumatic stress disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage, or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight-hundred-thousand men
Are still fighting the Vietnam War

So In Love,Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark,"new wave, synthpop","Talk to me, don't lie to me
Save your breath
Don't look at me, don't smile at me

Only For Love,Limahl,synthpop,"You will find itself deceiving love can be unsure
Keep a level head maintain your pride
Then you can face the situation straight in the eye
And especially when she comes on strong
When she smiles that smile that leads you on
Try to see it through playing out your part
Making certain when you give your heart it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
Love was never planned ever before
Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure
But as suddenly as that love will arrive
And you'll recognize the feeling ooh you're on fire
And especially as she moves in close
When she moves that move there's no suppose
You'll find you're hunting when you're apart
But when you give your heart it's
Only for love

We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touched me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye
When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

Find A Way,Amy Grant,"christmas, ccm, christian","You tell me your man's untrue
You tell me that you've been walked on
And how you feel abused
So you stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
I hear you saying that you want to see changes
But you don't know how to start
Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way

Love can make a way

Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way
I know this life is a strange thing
I can't answer all the whys
Tragedy always finds me
Taken again by surprise

I could stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
But I know that love can bring changes
And so we've got to move on

It's gettin' late
I can't wait
Come-a-come-a little closer
You've gotta tell me that you'll stay

I've been praying for this moment (Can't wait)
Since the second I laid eyes on you (It's gettin' late)
Minutes seem like hours when you're gone
Girl, I'm getting tired of waiting (Can't stay)
So stop your hesitating (Can't wait)
(It's gettin' late)
I can't believe you keep me hanging on

(It's gettin' late-ate-ate-ate)

Time waits for no one
Love is a turn on

It's gettin' late
And I can't wait
Come-a-come-a little closer
You've gotta tell me that you'll stay

You got me in a situation
My love is rising high (Can't wait)
(It's gettin' late)
And don't let any more love pass us by
Girl, we can make it up to paradise (Can't stay)
Just give it a try (Can't wait)
So hurry now and girl, make up your mind (It's gettin' late)

Don't know how much more I can stay

Call Me,Go West,"mexican hip hop, g-funk, latin hip hop","Face to face
My reflection in your eyes
I was scared to say too much
Perfect strangers in perfect worlds apart
Almost close enough to touch
Staring at my shoes
Feeling so confused
Shot down without a gun
Victim of a hit-and-run
