Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart

I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

(Who will? Who will? Who will?)

Ladies, let's go (Uhh)
Soldiers, let's go (Dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just, you know, give you a little situation
Listen (Fellas)

You see this shit get hot
Every time I come through when I step up in the spot (Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer wit' it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta wit' it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number, but make sure you call before you leave

I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?

Fight the feeling (Fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (Leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love (Oh)
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

You have to play fair (You have to play fair, yeah)

Okay, I see how it's goin' down
Seem like shorty wanna little ménage pop off or somethin'
Let's go

Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish (Blueish)
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on (Ha)
Watch me and I'ma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, I don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cold so I could hit the both of y'all

See, I know she loves you (I know she loves ya)
I understand (I understand, yeah)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (Maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (Possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me (Hot)

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)

Behind These Hazel Eyes,Kelly Clarkson,christmas,"Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes",ohoh oh oh oh ohoh oh oh seems like just yesterday you were a part of me i used to stand so tall i used to be so strong your arms around me tight everything it felt so right unbreakable like nothing could go wrong now i cant breathe no i cant sleep im barely hangin on here i am once again im torn into pieces cant deny it cant pretend just thought you were the one broken up deep inside but you wont get to see the tears i cry behind these hazel eyes i told you everything opened up and let you in you made me feel alright for once in my life now all thats left of me is what i pretend to be so together but so broken up inside cause i cant breathe no i cant sleep im barely hangin on here i am once again im torn into pieces cant deny it cant pretend just thought you were the one broken up deep inside but you wont get to see the tears i cry behind these hazel eyes swallow me then spit me out for hating you i blame myself seeing you it kills me now no i dont cry on the outside anymore anymore here i am once again im torn into pieces cant deny it cant pretend just thought you were the one broken up deep inside but you wont get to see the tears i cry behind these hazel eyes here i am once again im torn into pieces cant deny it cant pretend just thought you were the one broken up deep inside but you wont get to see the tears i cry behind these hazel eyes

All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine (That's right)
But I'ma start it at home
When I see a girl I like, I walk straight up to them and I'm like

Uh, hey girl, how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number, you'll get mine in exchange, hey
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffic jam booty, heads pausin' so fast, hey
I wouldn't trade you for the world, I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors coordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes (Woo)

Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Um, cause see me, my pimpin's in 3D

Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the Travel Channel to life?
One day we on the Autobahn swervin', drivin'
Next day, we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willie's on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlanta's Bronner Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C., it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up, it's more women for me, hey

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night, I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazz Fest
In Mardi Gras, all the women tryna show me they chest, ay
I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago
Uh, oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real (Woo)

Now ladies, look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it ain't no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, ""Put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say, ""Put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counterclockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass, a-put your hands down
Now look down, look down
I need, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time

Like You,Bow Wow Featuring Ciara,r&b,"I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl, then she gotta be just (Like you)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

And every time I think about you
When you ride, when you call, when you come ('Round)
Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again
And every time you're out on the road (I'll make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)
That I'm your main chick who got that game chick
One and the same chick - the one you can hang with

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Okay, when you hit the mall, pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough, that's when I shared more
I give you dis, give you dat, what you need, love?
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job, but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get wit you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense, I was tense
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together, say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean (Oh my god, do you see them?)
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
'Cause I'm the next big thing in

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills


The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

No, I don't, I'm just a no-class beat-down fool
And I will always be that way (Yes, you will)
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is freely
Turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track

Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc

Cool,Gwen Stefani,Pop,"Lyrically, the song is about a broken up couple… Read More 
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I've found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard?
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool


And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

Just The Girl,The Click Five,Pop,"She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on one-hundred proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

And when she sees it's me
On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringin' in my head
Still ringin' in my head
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more

Best Of You,Foo Fighters,"rock, post-grunge, alternative rock, grunge, modern rock","I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Before I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holler 'cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin' up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me, now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me, now

As Good As I Once Was,Toby Keith,country,"She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was",she said ive seen you in here before i said ive been here a time or two she said hello my name is bobby jo meet my twin sister betty lou and were both feeling kinda wild tonight youre the only cowboy in this place and if youre up for a rodeo ill put a big texas smile on your face i said girls i aint as good as i once was i got a few years on me now but there was a time back in my prime when i could really lay it down and if you need some love tonight then i might have just enough i aint as good as i once was but im as good once as i ever was i still hang out with my best friend dave ive known him since we were kids at school last night he had a few shots got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool with a couple of redneck boys one great big bad biker man i heard david yell across the room hey buddy how bout a helping hand i said dave i aint as good as i once was my how the years have flown but there was a time back in my prime when i could really hold my own but if you wanna fight tonight guess those boys dont look all that tough i aint as good as i once was but im as good once as i ever was i used to be hell on wheels back when i was a younger man now my body says you cant do this boy but my pride says oh yes you can i aint as good as i once was thats just the cold hard truth i still throw a few back talk a little smack when im feeling bullet proof so dont double dog dare me now cause id have to call your bluff i aint as good as i once was but im as good once as i ever was may not be good as i once was but im as good once as i ever was

How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found (Got found)

And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand


All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
Ooh-ooh

Birds go flyin' at the speed of sound

This is 50 comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though 'cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil' low 'cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me, dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now Captain, come on and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed, that's without a doubt
But shawty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh, man""

Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside


I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss) It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies

Lonely No More,Rob Thomas,Pop,"Now it seems to me that you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More than ever, baby

But I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more

Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?

I don't wanna be lonely no more

What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you?

Because there's gotta be something more

I get home, 7:30
The house is dirty, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate

A freak in the mornin', freak in the evenin'
I'm looking for a freak when I'm done, block bleedin'
Now take me to a house, tease me, then please me
And tell all her friends how the dick made her sleepy
Believe me, when I'm up in it I'm beatin' it
Givin' y'all that Mike Jones treatment
I could tell by the way she walk that she got it
Body so deadly, you can tell when she drop it
I'm either gonna hit her or I'ma be assed out
I've seen her walk by me, damn near passed out
Then crept up behind her, told her it was time to
Let a playa like me get in that vagina

Take her clothes off for cheese, love smokin' weed

Ay payita mía, guárdate la poesía
Guárdate la alegria pa' ti
Y oye, dámelo

No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Y tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos y hablando de ella

Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adiós

Que esto es una vez, es otra vez
Que esto es una vez, es otra vez

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay amor, es una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso y nos decimos adiós

Y oye, dámelo

No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mí que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Y como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

Now I'ma tell you what Em told me, homie
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo sho
I got the info you already know
Man, I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

You know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it

You wanna search me, then search me, but hurry up, 'cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink 'til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make 'em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit, these tricks'll frame ya (Word)
But, in any event, keep fuckin' with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club, feed them liquor otherwise we starve 'em
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

You know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got

Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it

You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I'll play, I stay, I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm, you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook, I clean, I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

You know I got

Let Me Go,3 Doors Down,post-grunge,"One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Just let me go
Let me go

And no matter how hard I try
I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
When all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me, but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Just let me go

And you love me, but you don't

How To Deal,Frankie J,R&B/Soul,"No, ooh

Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
'Cause if I don't, I'll probably regret it
But if I do, I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live
How do I deal without you?

It's killing me to know that your heart's with me
But you're with him 'cause I chose to be in this industry
Money, shows, and hoes come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it (About it)
But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you?

But she loves me, but she can't stand lovin' you far away?

You just deal with it, deal with it

Summer Nights,Lil Rob,"mexican hip hop, latin hip hop, g-funk","I'm feelin' good (Feelin' alright tonight)
I'm feelin' good now (Yeah)
It's all good in the neighborhood, holmes, haha, yeah
Lil Rob
I feel good, I feel alright
Cruisin' through my neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good, that's right
I feel good now (Somethin' about these summer nights)

(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Called the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's 7:30 and the sun's goin' down
It's a summer night and the fun's goin' down
I pick her up and she looks all dolled up (She look good)
Sittin' passenger in my rag Impala (Yeah)
I let her know that she looks beautiful to me
The world's an ugly place, but she is such a sight to see
The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend her summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruisin' with my lady
Playin' some Ralfi Pagan, ooh, baby, baby
I see my homeboys and they're cruisin' in their ride (Hey, wassup holmes?)
With their ladies sittin' by their side
People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
But then again, that's only if you ask me

(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

My homeboys throwin' a backyard boogie, so everybody
Gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
The DJ's spinnin', so I grab the mic and be like
""Ain't nothin' like them summer nights""
The party's packed with beautiful women
And the gang of the homies that wanna get with 'em
And they'll say anything just to hit 'em
And it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em
I don't know, it must be something in the air
Can't help but have a good time because the feelin' is there
To some people, the feelin' is rare
They're at the pad sayin', ""God damn, I wish I was there""
To have a drink, have a toke and hook up
With someone fine, but the kind that looks up
Gotta keep some pisto in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with this life, otherwise it's just a waste
Either way, I'm gonna party just in case
Like Prince partied like it was '99 in '87, '88
I couldn't ask for no better weather
I'm right next to the Pacific, to be specific
The candy paint job glows under the moonlight
As I close out my summer night and say goodnight
It's time to put the top up and park it
Drop it, unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk in the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long, from dusk 'til dawn
But it's not quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone, it won't be long
Eight more months, then once again it's on

(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

Breathe (2 AM),Anna Nalick,Pop,"2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands

And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe

In May, he turned twenty-one on the base of Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands

And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe

There's a light at each end of this tunnel, you shout
'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around

2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to

But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand

And breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe
Oh, breathe
Just breathe",2 am and she calls me cause im still awake can you help me unravel my latest mistake i dont love him winter just wasnt my season yeah we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes like they have any right at all to criticize hypocrites youre all here for the very same reason cause you cant jump the track were like cars on a cable and lifes like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button girl so cradle your head in your hands and breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe in may he turned twentyone on the base of fort bliss just a day he said down to the flask in his fist aint been sober since maybe october of last year here in town you can tell hes been down for a while but my god its so beautiful when the boy smiles wanna hold him maybe ill just sing about it cause you cant jump the track were like cars on a cable and lifes like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button boys so cradle your head in your hands and breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe theres a light at each end of this tunnel you shout cause youre just as far in as youll ever be out and these mistakes youve made youll just make them again if you only try turning around 2 am and im still awake writing a song if i get it all down on paper its no longer inside of me threatening the life it belongs to and i feel like im naked in front of the crowd cause these words are my diary screaming out loud and i know that youll use them however you want to but you cant jump the track were like cars on a cable and lifes like an hourglass glued to the table no one can find the rewind button now sing it if you understand and breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe oh breathe just breathe

Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

Girl give me that pussy

Girl give me girl give me that there

So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie

Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out

Right Here,Staind,Hard Rock,"I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how could you collect them all and throw them in my face?

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending 'til I break

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

This Is How A Heart Breaks,Rob Thomas,Pop,"Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess out of me
It left me caught between

I was stranded

And I'm steady, though I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take

Well, this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake

Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine, you and I
Yeah, why you gotta make it so hard on me?
Hey, it's hard on me

Never get what I want, never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew

My body, your body (Is burnin' up)

I don't know why, but the ladies call me Baby Blue then stick 'em
They take me and rape me and make me their victim
I lick 'em and freak 'em, if they married, I sneak 'em
If they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunnin' through the city tryna find a lady who's
Beautiful but she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue gon' let you do what you wanna do
You could feel on it if you really want to, ah-hoo-ah
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami, bustin' you like a tommy
I'm ahead of my class, gettin' head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag, see Benjamin head on the cash

I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rollin' down 95 (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Uh, yeah, yes, sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutie pie (Uh, yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Uh, yeah, yes, sir)

Top down, Bluestar tag
Oak match the bear skin rugs in the jag
Spectac' with the bad chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a Everlast punchin' bag
Hotter than a Bisquick biscuit out the oven
Your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin'
We kissin' and huggin', she never pick the phone up
You be lookin' for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get the back-to-back orgasms
Yes, sir, the game is automatic
Give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

Well let me step up in this thang right, lookin', smellin' good
Lookin' good, Spec' and Baby Blue and Pleasure, fool (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top, pull up in the parkin' lot
Grab a grape soda, bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside rims minglin' with my homeboys
Fake dap, fake hugs, leave me 'lone, boy
Plus the Caddy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' 'cross the street
But on the other hand, Alfalfa just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the Ball Hog, baby, let's go
The block was thick no questions asked
So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here, girl

Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself, ""We all lost touch""
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
If it's a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Oh chariot, your golden waves

Inside Your Heaven,Carrie Underwood,country,"I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone (Done)

Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way

'Cause you, super bad and for real though ('Kay)
Ooh can't wait for my lips to kiss your lips, both sets
But you don't hear me though, hear me though (Ooh yes)

I can make you believe any lie

And I've been known to cause a few births

Or get you fired from work

And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
Lots of big money
And helping white people dance

But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach

I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two
That I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you

At the door, I tell her take her clothes off, shiiit

Shorty so seductive dancing on me
It's the way that she move that's making me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'mma turn over and tell her ""let's do it again""

I put the G in G-Unit
Baby I got game
Any more good to go
And I dunno your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car
Meals from the shot bar
Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth, you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
Going to the tele and your getting popped off
I can't stop thinking of the things you do
When you freaking me and I'm freaking you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorties stick
Baby let me fly you in my lear
Stop, slow down baby
If you hear this in the club shake it go down baby
It's past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club, don't call my PO

Lets cut the small talk, you know why I approached you
I can't stand with a dime thats anti-social (Break it down!)
Gucci lip gloss, louis vuitton, and them boots from beneto vinetto cost her arm
Yayos a don, my car European
You got mirrors in your pants cause I see me in them (Woo)
Listen, I piss out Cris, inhale haze
In the marriott getting laid all day
Tattoos, and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black ass cum
I need groupie love (Yeah!), the coupe on dubs (Yeah!)
I'm in this club with a tre pound snub (Yeah!)
Don't blame it on David I'm all iced out
And 50 got me rich so the bar priced out (Come on!)

And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bear tuff thing come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Den dem wheel and pop-off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down and it a beat rapid

To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit nuh fit me
To win election dem trick we

Come on, let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most of the youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem tek the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Gloc, say dem a lock rocket
Dem wi full you up a current like ah shock socket
Dem wi run a road block which part the cops block it
And from now till a morning nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck-back ratchet

Long ago, just like the Hearse you die to get in again (One more time)
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst to take (Worst to take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long, and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So love your good night

Help Somebody,Van Zant,"southern rock, album rock, arena rock, country rock","Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man
He came from the school where you didn't need nothin'
If you couldn't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
""No Sir,"" ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""By God,"" ""Be darned,""
""Hell yeah, I'm American.""
In all the years he walked this earth
I swear all he did was work
He said: ""The devil dreams on an idle horse
""So you listen to me squirt
""Don't get too high on the bottle
And get right with the Man
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can. ""
Now Granny said: ""Sonny, stick to your ganas
If you believe in something, no matter what
'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than be loved for who you're not. ""
She was five feet of concrete
New York born an' raised on a slick city street
She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground
Still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:
Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:

""Don't get too high on the bottle
Just a little sip ev'ry now and then
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""
Instrumental Break
(C'mon now.)
""I never let a cowboy make the coffee.""
Yeah, that's what Granny always said to my Grandad
And he'd say: ""Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once.""
And ""if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans.""
""Don't get too high on the bottle
Get right with the Man, son
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""

Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing,SHeDAISY,Country,"Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
And had it fall on your head
Well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles
Your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
Really gotta go - Oh no!

Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Ever sat yourself down when the
Seat is all wet
Or see your ""ex"" sucking face with
A little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
Best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
Bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!

Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)
Don't worry, don't worry

We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine

Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing

Making Memories Of Us,Keith Urban,country,"I'm gonna be here for you, baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
And I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Coming your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
But it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you
With a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust
Making memories of us

We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude, an' fire it up
Meet us out at Party Cove

Come on in, the water's fine
Just idle on over and toss us a line

Bass-trackers, Bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Uh, anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us

He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around

Something To Be Proud Of,Montgomery Gentry,"country, acoustic country","There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be

Well I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
But I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word, man the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane-switch raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war

Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned eighteen
Cause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything

I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage

Well I fell in love next thing I know
The babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs

Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of

Somebody's Hero,Jamie O'Neal,Country,"She's never rocked Central Park
To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl
(But)
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero
She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition

But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero
Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home

She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero",shes never rocked central park to a half a million fans screaming out her name shes never hit a shot to win the game shes never left her footprints on the moon shes never made a solo hot air balloon ride around the world no shes just your everyday average girl but shes somebodys hero a hero to her baby with a skinnedup knee a little kiss is all she needs the keeper of the cheerios the voice that brings snow white to life bedtime stories every night and that smile lets her know shes somebodys hero she didnt get a check every week like a ninetofiver but shes been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver for twenty years there at home until the day her girl was grown giving all her love to her was her lifes ambition but now her babys moving on and shell soon be missing her but not today those are tears of joy runnin down her face shes somebodys hero a hero to her daughter in her wedding dress she gave her wings to leave the nest it hurts to let her baby go down the aisle she walks right by looks back into her mothers eyes and that smile lets her know shes somebodys hero thirty years have flown right past her daughters staring at all the photographs of her mother and she wishes she could be like that oh but she already is shes somebodys hero a hero to her mother in a rockin chair she runs a brush through her silver hair the envy of the nursing home she drops by every afternoon feeds her mama with a spoon and that smile lets her know her mothers smile lets her know shes somebodys hero
Diamonds From Sierra Leone,Kanye West,rap,"Jay-Z would later jump on the track for the remix.
West explained the inspiration for the song to MTV:
Mark… Read More 
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

All Jacked Up,Gretchen Wilson,country,"Five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears
The next you know
The bartenders pouring
Shots are flowing
Got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies
When you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell
I have one more shot

Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue
Ten foot, two
With a bad attitude
Stepped right up
And knocked out my tooth
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due

Cause I was all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

Don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer

Oh my God, it's 2:00
I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool
And I broke my window

Hurt my elbow
Got me in though
Two foot later
Backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

All jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck
When you're all jacked up
Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Ooh, oooh, oooooh
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell
I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up

All jacked up
All jacked up
All jacked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",five of the pm rolls around theres a little old joint outside of town i only got time for a couple of beers and a jukebox song ringing in my ears the next you know the bartenders pouring shots are flowing got me stoning all i really know is that i should be going but im soaking up the moment im all jacked up all jacked up dont believe ive ever had this much one thing ive learned when you get tore up time sure flies when youre all jacked up it was getting mighty close to nine oclock what the hell i have one more shot then i winked at a boy at the end of the bar guess i mighta musta gone a little too far cause a big ol girl walked outta the blue ten foot two with a bad attitude stepped right up and knocked out my tooth guess i had it coming i deserved the due cause i was all jacked up all jacked up dont believe ive ever had this much one thing ive learned when you get tore up dont start no stuff when youre all jacked up dont have to go home but you cant stay here thats what they said when i got my last beer oh my god its 200 i cant find my keys and my trucks locked so i grabbed a tire tool and i broke my window hurt my elbow got me in though two foot later backed into the light pole all the town folk got a good show all jacked up all jacked up dont believe ive ever had this much one thing ive learned when you get tore up dont drive your truck when youre all jacked up jacked up all jacked up all jacked up ooh oooh oooooh one thing ive learned when you get tore up dont start no stuff when youre all jacked up one thing ive learned when you get tore up dont drive your car dont start no stuff in no bar hell i wouldnt even tell anybody where you are when youre all jacked up all jacked up all jacked up all jacked up yeah yeah yeah yeah

""And I brought—dreams""
""—dreams""
""—dreams""
""And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you""
""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you""

I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things,,,
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

Playa's Only,R. Kelly Featuring The Game,R&B/Soul,"I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce (Game, yo) Throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce (C'mon) I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor

Georgia Rain,Trisha Yearwood,country,"Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket, lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say?

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
The ol' dirt road's paved over now
Nothin' here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain
Couldn't wash away
The way I loved you to this day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way

On a Sunday night, I might bang me some Maze (Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby)

It's the People's Champ, I'm somethin’ like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 carats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say ""cheese"" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some honey love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that chrome grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways

Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm sittin'
